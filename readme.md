A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme based off the bones starter theme.

#### What's Different?
I've started with Bones. Pulled it apart. Made it a ton more modular. Included Gulp because every theme needs a good workflow task manager. Jeet's been added for a better grid coding experience. Titon.io has been added for fun, this may not stay. This theme will change, change again, and change even more.
