# Dan Starter Theme
A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme that was originally based off the bones starter theme.
http://themble.com/bones

It has undergone major changes and adjustments.

The framework can be viewed at http://framework.bydan.us

### Intended Use
This framework is intended to be used for quick site development. There are many items that need to be removed to eliminate unnecessary bloat before moving to production. 

Such as, once the few hover styles have been selected, delete all the unused options. Remove any effeckt.css styles not being used. These files are all very modular and built with scss so management shouldn't be too bad.


### What's Different?
I've started with Bones. Pulled it apart. Made it a ton more modular.
